= Expenses

This is the start of an Expense reporting app, based loosely on the one used in
Learning Tree Course 2771, but done to modern coding conventions and using 
Firebase or another modern storage mechanism.

== Building

Right now it builds with Gradle or Android Studio. Some steps were taken that
might enable building with Eclipse and/or Maven later.
